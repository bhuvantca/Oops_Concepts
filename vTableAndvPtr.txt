In C++, runtime polymorphism is realized using virtual functions.
The C++ language uses Vtable and Vptr to manage virtual functions.

Before going to see VTable and VPtr, We should know about Polymorphism and Virtual functions.

Polymorphism: 
	Polymorphism in C++ means the same entity (function or object) behaves differently in different scenarios.

A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person behaves differently in different situations.
